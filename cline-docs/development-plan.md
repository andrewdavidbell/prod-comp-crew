# Development Plan for AI Product Research System

## Project Purpose and Goals
- Automate product research using collaborative AI agents
- Generate objective technical comparisons from diverse sources
- Output standardised markdown reports with feature matrices

## Context and Background
- Configuration-driven architecture using YAML files
- OpenRouter integration with meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct model
- Serper API for web search capabilities
- Three-agent workflow (Researcher/Analyst/Comparer)

## Hard Requirements
- Support comparison of 2-5 products concurrently
- Validate technical specifications against industry standards
- Separate marketing language from factual data
- Generate standardised markdown reports
- Maintain under 2-minute response time per comparison

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core System Setup
- [x] Virtual environment configuration
- [x] Dependency installation validation
- [x] API connectivity tests
  - [x] OpenRouter access
  - [x] Serper search validation
- [x] Basic agent communication tests

### Phase 2: Data Processing Layer
- [x] Web scraping adapters
- [x] Specification extraction pipeline
- [x] Marketing claim detection system
- [x] Data normalisation framework
- [x] Test script for data processing layer

### Phase 3: Comparison Engine
- [x] Feature matching algorithm
- [x] Dynamic markdown templating
- [x] Matrix generation logic
- [x] Unit conversion system

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- [x] Automated test suite
  - [x] Unit tests (90% coverage)
  - [x] Integration tests
- [x] Performance benchmarking
- [x] Security validation
  - [x] API key handling
  - [x] Data sanitisation

### Phase 5: Deployment Preparation
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [x] Docker containerisation
- [x] CI/CD pipeline implementation
- [x] Error handling system

## Additional Components
- [x] Setup script (setup.py)
- [x] Example script (src/example.py)
- [x] README.md with installation and usage instructions
- [x] Output directory for storing comparison reports

## Implementation Notes
- Changed LLM model from DeepSeek-chat to meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct due to availability
- All validation scripts are working correctly
- Phase 2 (Data Processing Layer) has been completed and tested successfully
- Phase 3 (Comparison Engine) has been completed and tested successfully
- Phase 4 (Quality Assurance) has been completed with the implementation of:
  - Automated test suite with unit and integration tests
  - Performance benchmarking system with detailed reporting
  - Security validation for API key handling and data sanitisation
- Phase 5 (Deployment Preparation) has been completed with the implementation of:
  - Comprehensive error handling system with custom exceptions and logging
  - Docker containerization with docker-compose support
  - CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
  - Updated user documentation with deployment and troubleshooting information

## QA Checklist
- [x] All agents complete tasks sequentially
- [x] Report validation against markdown specs
- [x] Zero sensitive data exposure
- [x] Average response time < 120 seconds
- [x] 100% critical path test coverage
- [x] Documentation matches implementation
- [x] Cross-platform verification (macOS/Linux)
